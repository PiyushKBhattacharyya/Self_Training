# ⚛️ React Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook.

## Key Concepts
1.  **Virtual DOM**: React keeps a lightweight representation of the DOM in memory. When state changes, it compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only what changed (Reconciliation).
2.  **JSX**: JavaScript XML. Allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

## JSX Rules
- All tags must close.
- Return a single parent element (or Fragment `<>...</>`).
- Use `className` instead of `class`.
- Use camelCase for attributes (e.g., `onClick`).
