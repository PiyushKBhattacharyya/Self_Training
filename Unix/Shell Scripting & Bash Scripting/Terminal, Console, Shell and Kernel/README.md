# 📺 Terminal, Console, Shell, and Kernel

## Terminologies

1.  **Terminal**: The wrapper program that runs a shell and lets you enter commands (e.g., GNOME Terminal, iTerm2). Originally physical Teletype (TTY) devices.
2.  **Console**: A physical terminal directly connected to the machine (Main TTY).
3.  **Shell**: The command-line interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that processes your input.
4.  **Kernel**: The core OS component that manages hardware and resources.

## Relationship
**User** -> opens **Terminal** -> types in **Shell** -> Shell calls **Kernel** -> Kernel talks to **Hardware**.
