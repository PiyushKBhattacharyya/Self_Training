# 🌐 Network Configuration and Troubleshooting Commands in Linux

Computers in a network communicate using packets sent between hosts.  
Linux provides several essential commands for network configuration, diagnostics, and troubleshooting.

Below are the major tools used in Linux networking:

---

## 1. 🟢 ping (Packet Internet Groper)
Tests network connectivity between your system and another host.
- ✔️ Checks if the destination is reachable  
- 📉 Measures round-trip time (RTT)

**Example:**
```bash
ping google.com
```

---

## 2. 🔍 nslookup
Queries DNS servers to retrieve domain name or IP address information.

**Example:**
```bash
nslookup google.com
```

---

## 3. 🛣️ traceroute
Displays the path packets take to reach a destination.
- 🕵️ Helps identify network delays or failures.

**Example:**
```bash
traceroute google.com
```

---

## 4. 🌐 host
Simple DNS lookup tool that maps domain names to IP addresses.

**Example:**
```bash

```

---

## 5. 📊 netstat
