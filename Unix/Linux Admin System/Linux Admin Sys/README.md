# 🔑 Key Responsibilities of a Linux System Administrator

### 1️⃣ Linux File Systems  
Sysadmins must understand filesystem types such as **Ext2, Ext3, Ext4** to manage storage, partitions, and permissions.

### 2️⃣ File System Hierarchy  
The **FHS (File System Hierarchy)** defines where files and directories should exist in Linux.  
Example:

- `/etc` → Configuration files  
- `/var` → Logs  
- `/home` → User data  
- `/bin` → Commands  

### 3️⃣ Managing Root / Superuser  
The **root user** has full system privileges.  
Admins must safeguard root access to prevent misuse and maintain security.

### 4️⃣ Basic Bash Commands  
Linux administrators must know essential Bash commands:

- `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`  
- `cat`, `grep`, `find`  
- `chmod`, `chown`  

These are used daily to manage system operations.

### 5️⃣ Managing Files, Directories, and Users
