# 🅰️ Angular

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

## Key Concepts
1.  **Components**: Main building blocks (template + logic + styles).
2.  **Modules**: Containers like `AppModule` to group related code.
3.  **Services**: Classes for data fetching and business logic.
4.  **Dependency Injection**: Injecting services into components.

## TypeScript
Angular is written in TypeScript, which adds static types to Javascript.
```typescript
let message: string = "Hello";
```
