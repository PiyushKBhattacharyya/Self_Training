# 🐍 Python Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.

## Key Features
- **Readable**: Uses indentation instead of braces.
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line.
- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare variable types.

## How to Run
1.  **Terminal**: `python script.py`.
2.  **Interactive Shell (REPL)**: Type `python` in terminal.

## Indentation
Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define scope (blocks of code).
```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
```
