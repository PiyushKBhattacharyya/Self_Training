# 🚀 Javascript Introduction

Javascript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

## How it works
- **Browser**: Runs JS in the client (using engines like V8 in Chrome).
- **Node.js**: Runs JS on the server/machine.

## Console
The `console.log()` function is used to print output to the debugging console.

## Execution
To run a file `script.js`:
- In Browser: Include it in an HTML `<script src="script.js"></script>`.
- In Terminal (with Node): `node script.js`.
