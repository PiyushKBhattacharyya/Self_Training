# 🏁 Java Introduction

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Key Concepts
1.  **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Environment to develop Java applications.
2.  **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Environment to run Java applications.
3.  **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Component that actually executes the Java bytecode.

## Structure of a Java Program
```java
public class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code to be executed
    }
}
```

## Compilation & Execution
1.  Compile: `javac FileName.java` -> produces `FileName.class` (Bytecode).
2.  Run: `java FileName`.
